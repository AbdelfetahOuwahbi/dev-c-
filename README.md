Welcome everyone, to play the game you must have a sinse of predictions ,
The game requires 2 players , the first player enters a number, and the number tries to guess the entered number, 
The game contains 2 levels , 1st level where the 1st user can not use the same number multiple times & 2nd level where the 1st user can use the same number multiple times,
The game also has the jocker option where the second user can reveal a number's place and value from the numbers entered by the 1st user
Try the game yourself , i hope you enjoy it 
THANKS :)
